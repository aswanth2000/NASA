# Project Data Wizz

## High-Level Summary
Climate change and global warming are critical issues that everyone is familiar with today. While the awareness of their importance is growing, understanding the rapidity of these changes remains a challenge. Our project, "Data Wizz," aims to analyze and visualize climate data to tell a compelling story. Starting from the 1880s and continuing into modern times, the project highlights the exponential rise in CO2 emissions and its correlation with global temperature increases. Inspired by Mahatma Gandhi's words, "Be the change that you want to see," we aim to encourage responsible actions among all inhabitants of our planet through this initiative.

## Project Details
We developed a static website for the challenge "Tell Us a Climate Story." The website presents data analyses and visualizations to raise awareness about climate change and its causes.

### Features and Structure

#### **Introduction**
This section introduces key terms like global warming and ocean acidification.

#### **Cause**
This section explains the root causes of climate change and global warming, emphasizing human negligence and its destructive impact on our planet and its biodiversity.

#### **Data Analysis**
This section includes data visualizations created from datasets that highlight:
- Total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
- Global surface temperature trends
- Global temperature anomalies
- Atmospheric CO2 emissions

**Datasets Used:**
- [Greenhouse Gas Emissions Data](https://ourworldindata.org/greenhouse-gas-emissions)
- [Global Surface Temperature Data](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs_v4/)

#### **Conclusion**
The conclusion emphasizes the results of the analysis and outlines actionable steps for individuals to contribute to mitigating climate change. The goal is to foster awareness and inspire actions that will ensure a better planet for current and future generations.

## Benefits
The website simplifies complex climate data into an easily understandable format suitable for children, adults, and the elderly. By embedding this awareness, we aim to inspire meaningful change and encourage collective responsibility.

## Tools and Technologies
The following tools, languages, and frameworks were used to develop the project:
- **Programming Languages:** Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
